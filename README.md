# Description of the Commodity Connection Study

This paper was written in the second half of 2019, as part of the subject ECOM30004/ECOM90004 (undergraduate/graduate version, taught as one subject). I was a 2nd year undergraduate student at the time, majoring in mathematics (statistics and stochastic processes).

My primary role was to collect time-series data from various sources (ABS, RBA) and to process it so that it would be more suitable inside vector auto-regression (VAR) models. VAR models require data to meet certain assumptions in order for results to be valid.

Data was processed using R, utilising various libaries.

* ggplot2
* fpp2 (Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 2nd edition)
* seasonal (for seasonal adjustments to time-series models)
* tidyverse
* urca (for unit root, co-integration tests)

The data section was written in R Markdown.

EViews was used in the modelling section.

The discussion was done in Microsoft Word.
